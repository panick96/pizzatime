# Pizza Anyone?

This is a two week sprint I did to help me learn the Java language. I have been programming in Python for about a year and decided to learn another language to broaden my opportunities. 

This is just a simple software that works with arrays and multidimensional arrays to allow you to rank your favorite pizza places. The software works around a numeric menu system. If you chose the default stores it will give you the top 4 stores in the U.S. in 2020. You can rank the stores from any range you deem fit (I used 1 to 10). The program will ask you for your favorite and least favorite part of the pizza and that will affect your personalized scores. 

To learn, I find it best to learn about the subject with a topic I enjoy. I love pizza so it was just a fun little thing to learn the language and practice using classes in Java. For two weeks I feel like I can do simple tasks in Java and hope to be able to continue my learning.

# Development Environment

JDK is a necessary install to run the Java code.
Java Version 16.0.1

# Useful Websites
I used these websites mainly to learn Java. I would occasionally Google search if I came across errors or something in my code was not working right.
